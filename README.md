# Beginning Swift
Take your first foray into programming for Apple devices with Swift.Swift is fundamentally different from Objective-C, as it is a protocol-oriented language. While you can still write normal object-oriented code in Swift, it requires a new way of thinking to take advantage of its powerful features and a solid understanding of the basics to become productive.


## What you will learn
* Explore the fundamental Swift programming concepts, language structure, and the Swift programming syntax
* Learn how Swift compares to other computer languages and how to transform your thinking to leverage new concepts such as optionals and protocols
* Master how to use key language elements, such as strings and collections
* Grasp how Swift supports modern application development using advanced features, such as built-in Unicode support and higher-order functions


### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: 2.6 GHz or higher, preferably multi-core
* **Memory**: 4GB RAM
* **Hard disk**: 10GB or more
* An Internet connection
